This program is 100% inspired by this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNSY86tEFw
The code is very messy... I'm going to clean it soon.


####Requisite
You need SFML2 in order to run the simulation.

####Usage

```
./NeuralColor POPULATIONSIZE
```

All the tuning (Mutation Probability, Color to find) need to be done in the code. I will add those parameter later.
